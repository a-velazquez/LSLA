I couldn't verify this data in the sources. In the FIAN-Transational Institute report (2009, p.87-88), it is said that Urapalma ""promoted"" the culture of 1500 ha of oil palm in the collective lands of communities located between Curvarado and Jiguaimando rivers. These lands, which cover 22022 ha, are the target of Urapalma and its partners.

Latest (27/11/2018): A report from Justicia y Paz said that URAPALMA owned almost 18 thousands hectares in the collective holdings of the communities of the river basins of Curvaradó and Jiguamiandó. It was stated that through an illegal form of accession (bifurcation of a river to gain land), the company extended its property to 12719 hectares in the holding of Curvaradó and 5000 Hectares in Jiguamiandó. Additionally, according to a media report (Semana), they had planted 3160 hectares by 2005, and from them 900 were in operation.

There were several massive displacements in the area in the years 1997 and 2001 by paramilitary forces in what was known as the operation ""Génesis"". The outbreak of violence and continuous threats to the peasants and afrocolombian communities to leave the area brought a wave of land purchases. The legal battle was about the right of the buyers to acquire this land. Colombian legislation prohibits to acquire any holding that has been collectively allocated, as were they. The palm oil companies sued the process and argued that the INCODER (land institution in Colombia by then) was supposed to legalize these acquisitions, which at one point occurred, but was reversed afterwards. Some managers of the involved companies are now in prison.

After they returned to their land, peasants were obliged to sell it in very injust conditions. Others were killed. According to a Friend of the Earth report, in the Chocó region, there were a paramilitary recolonization of afrocolombian communities' territories, which has been recognized by the State after the 1991 constitutional reform. Urapalma is one of the investors who planted oil palm on afrocolombian people's territories. Like other palm-growing companies, Urapalma benefited from public credits by the Banco Agrario and technical assistance by USAID. INCODER (land state agency) functionaries helped oil palm companies to keep the land they illegally occupied. National army's XVII Brigade helped the same companies repressing local people. 
It shoud be stated, though, that URAPALMA never received money from USAID, because on the application process they did not send the proper documentation. See Thomson (2011).

President Uribe brought strong political support to oil palm expansion in the Choco region, considering this product as strategic.

Latest update (27/11/2018) - After massive displacements suffered from in 1997 and 2001, the abandoned land was bought by several entrepeneurs related to paramilitary leaders in the region. The INCODER (land institution of Colombia by then) tried to allocate holdings that were already collectively allocated, something that is forbidden by law. There were some indications of corruption at the regional level. Not only URAPALMA, but several companies were related to this case. Nevertheless, Urapalma is the only company in this deal since it is the mostly mentioned in the literature and media reports. It is extremely difficult to realize the actual size of the deal  because of the displacement occurrences and the great amount of different companies involved in this process.

The toll road between Palenque and San Cristobal is the axis of a luxurious touristy project that according to Chiapas government will make of the state the “second Cancún”, in the frame of the Touristy National Agreement by Calderón’s federal government. This project is painted as ecological to be sold in the global carbon market, for what Chiapas signed an agreement with California State.

The datas might be from an other numero of the same review, Revista Agraria, perhaps this of june 2006 (about land concentration). In this case, the agricultural firm produces above all asparagus, whose Peru is the world first exportator. One of the problems of this especialization (perhaps most than land concentration), in particular in the Ica Valley, is the water consumption. Peru's coastal desert depended from the Andes's glaciers for its water supply, but climatic change is making these glaciers desappear. So, the intensive agriculture at big scale for export in what Peru had been especializing itself is unsustainable. ";No;;

This strong political support boosted oil palm production in Colombia, and therefore land adquisitions and land pressure.

There was an important occurrence and was the enactment of one law that obliged that the fuels in Colombia should have at least 10% of its components of biodiesel. This fraction is supposed to increase up to 20%. This fostered and guaranteed an increasing demand of oil palm in the domestic market.

Given that the lands under the ownership of the DAABON group were likely obtained in the 1970s, this company is not mentioned in this deal. Palmeras de La Costa is present since the 1970s in the municipality of El Copey in Cesar, Colombia. Nonetheless, it is confirmed that after a violent paramilitary presence at the end of the past millenium, the company started to acquire some land plots abandoned by conflict victims. It is impossible to determine the dates of land acquisition of any plot. It is certain that at least two of them were acquired in 2003. The Colombian court of land restitution issued a document in which is stated that these land plots should be returned to the previous owners. According to the document, these land transfers were done without the proper consent of the smallholders or were achieved through violent repressions and threats.;No;;

Additionally, there has always been presence of armed groups in the area and some of them are threatening environmental, land right activists and some peasants to sell their lands. Furthermore, the company was recognized for the government of Colombia as being one of the companies accumulating irregularly land that was intended for landless peasants. Something that is prohibited by law 160 of 1994.

One of their plots, Macondo, was sold in 2002 for COP 30 Million due to the conflict. It was bought by Poligrow for COP 4000 Million. After some time, the previous owner of the land was claiming for it because he never agreed to sell it. Due to the hard conflict in this area he had to leave. The government developed a law in 2008 in which no abandoned land could be transferred in those areas without the approval of the municipality council, which happened in 2008. It seems that there was corruption involved. Some witnesses argue that in the area is impossible to buy land without the paramilitary groups knowing about that and that paramilitary groups are threatening land right activists.

Only in Mapiripán, from 1997 until 2007, 12812 people were displaced (not necessarily because of Poligrow), which means deep roots of the conflict in this area. This number might be underestimated, since not all displaced made the proper registration.

This number might be way too low, though, since the company had an agreement to purchase 70000 hectares of state land, after several smallholders apply for land allocations. This is prohibited by the law 160 of 1994, which means that Poligrow might be acting against the Colombian law. The company is currently in the production phase and has planted almost 7000 hectares of oil palm, although it also has Jatrofa fields. This company has been extremely controversial in Colombia because of the irregular accumulation of land it pretends to do. Additionally, it is located in a municipality where the conflict has been extremely constant and suffered in 1997 one of the worst massacres in Colombian history, done by paramilitary groups.

Some of the plots that Poligrow acquired are under legal processes because they were left abandoned, and for this to be allowed, a municipal committee had to agree on that; it seems that this approval was given under cases of corruption (the mayor by these time is in jail for this). Additionally, land right and environmental activists, as well as workers of the company are being threaten by armed groups in the zone. Interviewees mention that it is strange that the legal representative of the company can move freely in this area, will every citizen has to be aware of the presence of these armed groups.

The investor tree (see section above) signals that the company might have been creating fictional companies to have access to more land, which in theory is not illegal, but highly unethical, according to some congressmen in Colombia.

Another critical point of this deal is the way it affects indigenous communities in the area. The Jiw and the Sikuani ethnic groups are not being allowed to their ancestral sites. Additionally, the hunting and gathering which is now prohibited in the areas of the company might put them under food constraints. Nevertheless, the government, by the Ministry of Interior, asserted that in the project's area of influence there were no Indigenous groups, although they were 6.5 Kms away.

It seems impossible to distinguish the details of the respective projects - therefore I added this case as one, under COFCO Tunhe.

(2017) COFCO Tunhe changed its name to COFCO Tunhe Sugar, although there are some articles saying that tomato production are under the COFCO Tunhe Tomato but it is not on the website of the company.

AgroMoz is reported to be a joint venture between the Grupo Américo Amorim of Portugal, a holding company of Portugal's richest man Américo Amorim, and Intelec, which the US embassy has described as ""an investment vehicle for President Guebuza"". The Pinesso Group of Brazil, which operates farms on over 180,000 ha in Brazil and 22,000 ha in Sudan, handles the agricultural operations, but it is not clear if they also own a share in the company.

Information from company registry documents and employee websites suggests that AgroMoz is in fact part of AGS Moçambique, SA., a Mozambican company owned by two Portuguese subsidiaries of Grupo Amorim (Solfim SGPS and Sotomar - Empreendimentos Industriais e Imobiliários, S.A.) and ESF Participaçoes, a subsidiary of ESF Investimentos, which is owned by Intelec and SF Holdings, both of them headed by Guebuza's main business partner Salimo Abdula.

The length of time workers had their wages withheld varied, depending on when they first arrived at the plantation. Workers who arrived at the palm oil plantations earlier tended to have their wages withheld for longer. In October 2016, workers from Dagon Timber told civil society organizers that their wages had been withheld for four months. It was only after the complaints were filed and the police investigated the situation that the workers were given their payment.

They had no time to say no except yes while the mayor fixed the amount to be paid to them.

In spite of the help from the previous mayor and engineer Titi Redillas in negotiating the land, many of the tunnel owners and small-scale miners refused to sell their land and tunnels. Then the company arbitrarily bulldozed the tunnel of small-scale miners. One of the victim was Cerilo Niebla, vice chairman of the Sibutad Small-Scale Miners Multi-purpose Cooperative (SSSMMPC). His tunnel has existed since 1987, while the company only arrived in Sibutad in the 90�s. The company�s negotiator approached him but he refused. But the company went on its way and bulldozed and burned all structures and necessary equipment that they have built and procured. He has demanded that he be paid for the destruction. The case is in the court.

A refinery was erected here in the 20th to dispose of these factories. However, due to the lack of proper purification, a large amount of chemical waste is constantly mixing with the adjacent rivers and canals. Water is being polluted. Locals alleged that the waste from Comilla EPZ was dumped into the water without proper purification. In this, at least 20 villages of Sadar upazila including Rajapara, Dishabandh, and Kazipara are being contaminated with canal water. The odor is spreading, the risk of disease is increasing.

Environmentalists fear that the waste will gradually increase if the waste is not properly purified.

Potential: Deforestation and loss of vegetation cover

ESIA published in 2020. It is not clear whether the contract had been signed by then.
With a view to facilitating the implementation of the project to create an agro-industrial complex by the company CAMVERT, the Ministry in charge of forests has launched a public notice N ° 0082 / AP / MINFOF / DF / SDIAF / SC of May 15, 2019 for the downgrading of a portion of 60,000 ha of FMU 09 025.";2021-09-12#current#In operation (production);"The community discovered that Camvert SARL has begun setting up a nursery for oil palm saplings.

According to the report, the seeds planted by Camvert were supplied by a subsidiary of CIRAD, a French-funded organization called PalmElit, which  is a simplified joint stock company owned by CIRAD and Sofiprotéol. Palmelit had agreements to sell seeds to a Cameroonian intermediary specializing in the sale of agricultural seeds which then sold seeds to Camvert. The new Palmelit's sales contracts stipulate that these seeds can only be resold and used by companies committed to respecting the RSPO standard.;41888;Camvert Sarl;Cameroon;Private company;;;The project is said to be 100% Cameroonian.;The Nyete and Campi community#Nkoelon#Bagyeli#Nyamabande#;Bagyeli indigenous peoples.#;Cameroun Vert SARL (Camvert) is operating in an area inhabited by 28 local communities. The forest is also a cultural asset and spiritual sanctuary for the Bagyeli indigenous peoples.;;;Limited consultation;The discovery that Camvert has begun clearing forest and establishing a nursery leads NGOs to fear the public consultation and legally mandated review process are rigged. According to Aristide Chacgom, Coordinator of GDA.The Camvert project must be stopped altogether and the responsible authorities be sanctioned. This because they’ve allowed a project to go ahead, which has violated national and international provisions and undermines communities’ access to critical non-timber forest products on their land. Greenpeace Africa’s Rènece Ndjeudja added: “Instead of forest destruction, the Bagyeli’s Indigenous rights and Bantu customary rights must be recognized and their voices fully heard and biodiversity protected. This can only be achieved through the implementation of inclusive and participatory land use planning. In the meantime, the Minister of State Property must be investigated and Camvert’s plans cancelled.;Mixed reaction;"The chief of the WOab of Nyete declared that he was not comfortable with the decision to allow Camvert to achieve its objectives, given that the presence of other companies like Hevecam and Socapalm [ Société Camerounaise de Palmeraies ], has brought little change to the community because it is still impoverished. Romain Kowe , traditional chief of Ebodje, Campo district, is also not at ease with this agro-industrial project. However, in places like Campo, where there is little or no social infrastructure, the people are more receptive, hoping it will bring jobs and development. The  community does not want to work with Camvert .Désiré Ndongo, a notable of Nkoelon village, is categorical: ""To accept to collaborate with Camvert is to deceive ourselves because in advance, we villagers are losers,"" he adds.";;;;;;;;;;;Environmental degradation|Socio-economic|Cultural loss|Other;"The area to be exploited by CAMVERT Sarl, is currently home to varied species of wildlife, and it is feared that with trees cut down, these animals will be forced to look for new habitat and some might die along the way due to deforestation. Traditional activities, fishing in particular, are threatened. As forest people, there are sacred forests in which we do our rites that are in danger of disappearing. 
According to the ESIA The main negative impacts:- deterioration of the air quality;
- physicochemical and bacteriological pollution of water and soil;
- pressure on water resource and disruption of the stream flow;
- loss of vegetation and destabilization of wildlife habitat;
- increase in poaching;
- conflicts (the risks of conflict: with populations, human-animals, PNCM-Project);
- inflation risks
- risk of accidents at work and traffic;
- job loss and resurgence of unemployment
- The company  has violated the rights of indigenous and local communities and destroys their forest
- A member of the Bagyeli community does not hide her dismay: ""I am Bagyeli and we live thanks to the forest. Agro-industries make our lives hard. We have to travel miles now to have the necessary equipment to build our huts. 
-In Nyamabande, women live in half-built huts and therefore sleep in the open air for lack of building material.
-The land grab for a palm oil plantation about seven times the size of Dakar is agribusiness’ most serious assault on Indigenous rights in the region in years
Africa and GDA state: ""This illegal project is harmful to people, to the forest, to biodiversity, to the climate – and to good governance
-The company is attempting to buy off Indigenous Bagyeli people with gifts of canned tomatoes, bags of rice, and soap. Local Bantu villagers, whose land is also under attack, complain of systematic corruption of traditional chiefs, phoney consultation and destruction of crops by foraging elephants after forest areas were cleared by Camvert bulldozers.
-According to Greenpeace Africa Cameroon Campaign Manager, Ranèce Ndjeudja the Camvert project is a case of illegality and abuse of Indigenous rights that will aggravate the climate and biodiversity crises if it goes ahead. It is said to expose once again the perilous myth of sustainable forest management, as well as the growing problem of conversion of forests – including logging concessions certified “sustainable” by the Forest Stewardship Council – into agribusiness plantations in Cameroon";The company promises alternative jobs and activities like cattle breeding.;;Education|Productive infrastructure (e.g. irrigation, tractors, machinery...)|Roads|Capacity building|Other;"According to the ESIA The main enhancement measures:

According to Witness Radio since 2017 when the evictions started, communities have complained about acts of violence meted against them by multinational companies from sexual and gender-based violence against women, defilement, torture, beating, kidnap to illegal arrest and detention among others.

In  february 2021 the Witness Radio reported that families that lost their land to multinationals and currently trapped in the middle of the plantations have begun a year with fresh attacks from allegedly their evictors.Batumbya Charles, 61, a resident of Kikungulu village, Kitwala parish in Kiryandongo district is the first victim of fresh violence since 2021 started. Batumbya, a father of 15, whose land is in the middle of the sugarcane plantations owned by Kiryandongo Sugar Limited was attacked from his home on a previous Sunday at 8:00 PM by two unidentified plain-clothed men who were armed with pangas and batons. The multinational companies is  also accused of  of intimidation and forcing them to receive as little as Uganda Shillings 150,000 equivalent to US Dollar 40 as compensation and when one refuses, such conduct is deemed disrespectful by investors and attracts serious beating.

NGOs including Witness Radio – Uganda, GRAIN, and Alliance for Food Sovereignty in Africa released a Kiryandongo report “landgrabs at gunpoint”, which exposed gross human rights violations and abuses committed by security agencies and 3 multinationals against communities.

The residents returned to their village in 2015 after being given permission to do so by the KNU’s Mergui-Tavoy (Myeik-Dawei) District Brigade 4. Since the villagers only returned in 2015 and the company was granted the land in 2012, the villagers were never consulted. Those who were already in the village said they were not consulted -- the company just came and planted oil palm trees.;Rejection;According to a villager that was interviewed: We want our lands back and we don’t want those palm trees. If we wanted to we could have organised ourselves to plant those. In some areas, we planted [a few] of them […]. We just plant them next to our fences and houses. We dare not plant [a lot] because we didn’t get permission [from the company] to plant yet. […] We only want the lands back. We don’t want compensation.;Yes;The granting of concessions took place without considering the land tenure rights of local populations, land suitability, conservation of forest reserves, water sources or endangered species. This has led in some cases to land disputes. The company and villagers collided upon the villagers' return after being internally displaced by the war between Burma Army and Karen National Union army. Field research for the SWIA suggests that the villagers’ lack of written documentation of land tenure rights makes it difficult for the local government to return land to them.

The company confiscated land from local villagers in M’Saw to develop a palm oil plantation. They did not provide proper compensation. Many households remain displaced.

The company, which in 2000 was given over 9,012 acres on which to plant palm oil plantations, began suing the villagers for trespass in 2016.

The company confiscated around 1,000 acres of local people's land in Ler Muh Lah Township, Mergui-Tavoy District, resulting in livelihood difficulties for local civilians.

The territory of this indigenous community was surveyed, as determined by national law 26.160, by the National Institute of Indigenous Affairs in 2009.";Indigenous Peoples traditional or customary rights recognized by government;;;;;;Yes;"Chronology of the Conflict
-Towards the end of 2007, the company Genética del Este violently entered the territory of the community with tractors, heavy machinery, bulldozers, and rollers, and destroyed the possessions of the communities: planting fences, pastures, ancestral boundaries, local roads, tree plantations, etc. It destroyed an important mass of native forest and destroyed valuable archaeological sites, desecrating sacred places and indigenous cemeteries of the communities.

-In June 2008, the criminal court in charge of Jorge Salomón, for the alleged crime of ""damages"", charged Zenón Barraza (advisor of the Ayllu Codo), his son Hernán Barraza, Bernardino Barraza (Atuniyku -cacique- of the Ayllu), Hugo Leguizamón (advisor of the Ayllu Puncu Atun), the elder Nemesio Sequeiro and his son Sandro.

-In September of the same year, Nemesio Sequeiro was illegally deprived of his freedom by police personnel from the 20th section of Villa Atamisqui, while he was in hospital; and one of his sons, Enrique, when he went to the police station to ask about his father. They were released after the intervention of the National Institute of Indigenous Affairs (INAI).

-A few days later, Reina Coronel (Ayllu de Codo, wife of Councillor Durval Barraza) was savagely beaten and kicked on the road between the community and Villa Atamisqui by a local couple sympathetic to the businessmen. When she went to the hospital she was denied attention and when she went to file a complaint in the aforementioned police station she found that her aggressors were talking to officer Argañaraz, who decided to lock Reina up with the person who had attacked her, in the same cell, while he told them ""you can kill yourselves there if you want"".

﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿-On 20 November 2008, the Diaguita Cacano People presented a note to the Chief of Cabinet of Santiago del Estero (Elías Suárez), and to the Minister of Production (Luis Gelid), requesting compliance with ILO Convention 169 and national laws 24.071, 26.331 and 26.160, and consequently ""the inclusion of the forested region known as El Alto, territory and habitat of indigenous communities, in Category I"". That same day, in the evening, a police patrol led by Officer Enriquez, sent by Deputy Chief Leiva, in the town of Toro Uman, entered a private home without a search warrant and arrested Santos Acosta (Councillor of Ayllu Codo) and Ubaldo Rojas, from the same community. During the period of detention, they were physically and psychologically tortured by the deputy chief Leiva, who beat one of them shouting ""so you are an Indian"", while accusing both of having cut the fence of the company.﻿

-On March 2, 2009, Judge Juan Jorge ordered an intervention in the houses of the communities of the Ayllus of Puncu Atun and Codo, from Getoar (Special Tactical Group for High Risk Operations), together with members of Villa Atamisqui and Brea Pozo. On that occasion, they detained five members of the communities, including an elderly man of more than 80 years of age, Cecilio Barraza, who was handcuffed and thrown naked into an anthill where he was left for more than 4 hours. In the same procedure other elders, children who were preparing to attend their first day of school and women were severely beaten. In Section 20 of Villa Atamisqui, before being transferred to Alcaidía de Tribunales, the detainees were stripped naked and humiliated in their dignity.

-On 15 May of the same year, Judge Ramón Tarchini Saavedra ordered the kidnapping of the communities' animals, the main source of food for the families. On October 8, after almost five months of complaints, he orders a court instructor to stop asking about the animals (more than 120 cattle and mares), because they are all dead.

The work was attached to the source of information.The aim of this work was to analyse the changes in land use and land cover in the coastal plains of Baixo Jaguaribe and Camocim in the state of Ceará over a period of 33 years, using multi-temporal change detection techniques on active and passive sensor images to establish the relationship of the changes produced with the installation of wind farms.
deforestation of the mangrove forest, the carnaubal riparian forest, land dispossession, extinction of villages and expulsion of families from the community, not counting the transformation of the way of life of the community, especially in the exercise of work in the
mangrove. It should be noted that, according to the IBAMA study (2005), the generation of
jobs was six times less than that promised by the entrepreneurs in the industry, in addition to having generated sharp unemployment in the period of 2002 and 2003, when the activity started to present a drop in shrimp production, due to the appearance of diseases. The community already suffered with the promises of shrimp farming now finds itself in its habitat with the enormous windmills and with the same speeches of the entrepreneurs about economic development and social of the community previously heard with the arrival of carciniculture.

In short, it is verified through the testimonies of the interviewees
that, for the Cumbe community, the installation of the wind farm brought, in the view of some,
positive impacts such as renovation of houses, construction of squares, renovation of the local church, the road,
while for others, the company brought the privatization of public areas, destruction of sites

The Société d’études et de réalisation des phosphates de Matam (SERPM) was granted an exploitation permit issued by a ministerial order on May 29, 2008, for a period of three years. This concession concerned the Southwest Lobe perimeter of Ndendory. For the exploitation of the deposit, the SERPM resorted to the services of the company Tracto Services Equipements, owned by the Senegalese businessman Cheick Amar who in May 2008 obtained 388 billion CFA francs investment (700 millions of dollars) from an anonymous consortium with US, Lebanese, Egyptian and Canadian capital (1). The production of natural phosphates increased from 20,000 tons in 2008 to 25,000 tons in 2009. SERPM and its partner Afcor built a modular granulator plant for the treatment of the phosphates. In 2012, a contractual dispute led Afcor to sue SERPM (2). Originally 51% owned by the Senegalese state, Cheick Amar gradually took control of the SERPM shares. This acquisition is opaque because there was no open tenders call, as required by Article 80 of the Code des Marches Publics (3). In 2011, a new exploitation concession was awarded to SERPM, on the perimeter of Ndiendouri-Ouali Diala, commonly known as the phosphates de Matam, in the department of Kanel, covering a total area of 661 km2. The concession has a validity of 25 years. The two deposits’ reserves of Ndiendouri and Ouali Diala are respectively estimated at 30 and 12 million tons. Annual production of fine phosphates is 1.5 million tons. SERPM became the Société minière de la Vallée du fleuve Sénégal (SOMIVA), in which the Senegalese state holds 10% of the capital.;No;;

The area is home to the highest volcanoes in the Americas, such as the Pissis volcano at 6,882 metres above sea level and the Ojos del Salado volcano at 6,864 metres above sea level. ""There are lagoons and glaciers where the freshwater base is located, and it is one of the seven places in the world where flamingos are protected and a biosphere reserve area for global research,"" say opponents of the project. The communities concerned about the mining threat point out that, contrary to the company's claims, the company does not have a social licence to operate, and that it cannot consider that holding an assembly with no more than 40 people supporting the project means that they already have social approval. The Government of Catamarca has given its approval and the company can now design and operate pilot evaporation pits, as well as set up the necessary laboratories, set up permanent and semi-permanent camps, and complete the drilling programme that began in 2016 and is due to end in 2017. The company plans to continue with additional exploratory work and to develop the 3Q project, a real nightmare for the inhabitants of the area. According to neighbours grouped in the El Algarrobo Assembly in Catamarca, the multinational would be violating the South Ramsar sub-site, where the high Andean lagoons are located, endangering a valuable endangered species, such as the Andean flamingo. The area includes the Aparejos, Las Tunas, Azul, Negra, Verde and Tres Quebradas lagoons. The Aparejos Lagoon is the nesting site of the Parina Grande, better known as the Andean flamingo. Some specimens have already been found dead as a result of the exploration work already being carried out in the vicinity of Laguna Verde. The company acknowledged that it only has the affidavit issued by the enforcement authority at the time of submitting the Environmental Impact Report (IIA), so the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) required by the General Environmental Law and the National Mining Code has not been carried out. Nor has the public hearing or consultation required by the General Environmental Law (LGA) taken place. According to El Esquiú newspaper, a group of environmentalists recently blocked National Route 60 at the Guanchín area in Fiambalá. The measure was taken to protest against the Tres Quebradas lithium project camp, arguing that it ""does not have a social licence"". Seeking to favour the mining company, as is customary with Argentine officials, Eric Quiroga indicated that in the exploration stage ""a social licence is not needed"", because all that is required is that the Provincial Directorate of Environmental Mining Management gives authorisation for the stage. ""The social licence is needed when the exploitation stage begins, in other words, another stage is needed before this can be done,"" he said, and clarified that the social licence does not have to be granted by four or five people, but by the whole community.";;;Education;From the area of corporate social responsibility, the company offers training workshops in different areas.;Education;From the area of corporate social responsibility, the company offers training workshops in different areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;#current####Lithium;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;No;Local pre-processing is carried out, the extracted metal is converted to lithium carbonate and then exported.;;;No;;Groundwater;water will be sourced from a shallow well located approximately 4 km from the mine site.;;;;;;;;;No;;

Entendimos que si queremos hacer un proyecto sustentable, debe cumplir todas las normas”, indicó en primer lugar.
En cuanto al loteo, explicó que el misma buscará concretarse en la finca que posee 2300 hectáreas, pero el proyecto solo abarca “una superficie de 125 hectáreas, no es más del 5% del total de la finca”. Además indicó que la urbanización planificada es lejana a la Quebrada y no se intervendrá. “Jamás se lo pensó”, aseguró.

Así Cornejo se permitió aclarar alguna confusión que se había generado. “Es un área que generó confusión de bosques nativos sin intervención, eso no es correcto, ya la hay desde hace muchos años, y tiene especies no nativas, exóticas, muchas de ellas invasivas”, aseveró.
Todo lo contrario a estas confusiones, el desarrollador adelantó que el proyecto es sustentable dado que busca “la convivencia entre lo urbano y su entorno, planteamos una remediación del bosque implantando especies nativas y que haya armonía entre quienes habiten” el loteo con el espacio natural.
Lo mismo para el uso del agua, al aclarar que la finca “tiene derecho al agua históricamente desde 1958, tiene la documentación que da fe”. Dicho esto llamó a la calma aclarando que no tendrán intervención con las conexiones existentes en la villa turística. 

“Tenemos un sistema propio, vamos a usar nuestra infraestructura propia para abastecernos”, dijo Cornejo quien sumó dentro del proyecto el objetivo de “poner una planta propia de tratamiento de afluentes cloacales”, para usar el 80% de esa agua en el riesgo de las especies autóctonas que se reforestarán.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Greenpeace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;No;;

According to Brannstrom, Gorayeb, Loureiro and Mendes (2019), the construction of the Praia Formosa wind farm created obstacles that denied the physical access of Praia de Xavier residents to the headquarters of the district of Amarelas.

Furthermore, there was the privatization of resources for common uses such as dunes and mangrove areas. In addition to access, the installation of the park changed the natural dynamics of the dunes and mangroves, resulting in direct impacts on the economic and cultural activities of the local population. This change also generated impacts on the food security and sovereignty of the local population, since fishing was directly affected (some interdune lagoons no longer exist).

A contradiction is that until a year after the wind farm was implemented, the residents of the community next to the park did not have access to electricity.

Another question posed by respondents in the Leite & Picchi research (2019) is about the amount paid in lease contracts. In São José do Sabugi, Junco do Seridó and Santa Luzia, the contract establishes the “value of 1.5% of the generated energy, but according to reports, the tenants receive a fixed amount of R$1,000 to 1,500 reais per tower each month, depending on the location of the land, and, of course, the type of negotiation that the owner has established. Therefore, what is in the contract is not fulfilled and there is no standardization of payment per tower, even if the land is in the same region” (Leite & Picchi, 2019, p. 20).";As in other wind projects, the greatest promise and expectation of the population was around the generation of jobs and the consequent improvement in the quality of life.

Of the total 20 wind farms, eleven are in operation (321,700.00 kW granted) and nine have been approved (301,800.00 kW granted), but construction has not yet started. All wind farms came into effect in 2012, intensifying in 2015, which confirms the hypothesis of the implementation of wind projects after the 2007/2008 economic crisis.";2021#current#2468.0#Renewable Energy;;Lease;;2012#current#Concluded (Contract signed);;2017#current#In operation (production);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Complexo Eólico Cristal;;43616;Enel Green Power Cristal Eólica S.A.;Brazil;Private company;https://www.enelgreenpower.com/pt/paises/america-do-sul/brasil;;Enel Green Power Cristal Eólica S.A. - CNPJ: 12.851.920/ 0001-00;Pau de Colher#Lagoinha#Melancia#Pedras#Cafarnaumzinho#Alecrim#Cristal#Catuaba#Lagoa Nova#Lagoa do Curral#Destoque#Santa Úrsula#;;The impacted communities foreseen in the Environmental Impact Study (2011) are: Pau de Colher, Lagoinha, Melancia, Cafarnaumzinho, Pedras, Alecrim, Cristal, Catuaba, Lagoa Nova, Lagoa do Curral, Destoque e Santa Úrsula, assim como as sedes de Cafarnaum, Morro do Chapéu e Bonito.;;;Limited consultation;"According to the minutes of the public hearing held on November 5, 2011 regarding the environmental licensing procedure (location license) for the installation of the Cristal wind farm, the environmental studies on the installation of the park were presented to civil society and potentially affected population.

The environmental impact, in addition to the installation of wind turbines, is intensified by the need to expand access roads to the areas in which the project is located.
Furthermore, the wind farm is located in a region characterized by the strong presence of conservation units, such as Chapada Diamantina National Park and Morro do Chapéu State Park.
In the Environmental Impact Study of the Crystal Wind Complex, published in 2011, the following impacts are foreseen:";"According to the Environmental Impact Study for the Crystal Wind Complex, published in 2011, the promised benefits were:
- The Crystal Wind Complex will foster the development of an area (AID) of low socioeconomic development and clearly suitable for subsistence agriculture;
- It will allow a significant increase in the offer of work, even if temporary, during the project's implementation phase, to the population of the directly affected area;
- It will provide a relatively significant offer of specialized labor during the operation and maintenance phase of the Complex, inserting, after training and qualification, members of the local population;
- There will be an increase in the population's income, consequently increasing local commerce;
- There will be a significant increase in tax collection, which may be reverted, even if in part, to the municipality and region, improving the living conditions of the population established in these places;
- It will allow the implementation of new ventures, generating new effects in socioeconomic terms, with more jobs, increased income, increased consumption, increased revenue, among others;
- It will favor the birth of new productive arrangements, such as tourism, enabling the socioeconomic effects mentioned above;
- It will give a new visibility to the municipality.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;No;;

However the management of plantations is not very labour intensive, and the industry generates fewer jobs than the cattle ranches which made way for the plantations.

Fibre Sourcing The establishment of large monocultures is very detrimental to biodiversity and the conservation of valuable biomes. Eldorado Brasil has a landbank of 350,000 hectares in Mato Grosso do Sul, of which 220,000 hectares are eucalyptus plantations.
Eldorado claims it has an area of 106,000 hectares of preserved forests. However, the company does not provide geo-referenced maps of the areas it owns, leases or sources from. And though over 90% of its landbank is FSC-certified, FSC also does not disclose geo-referenced maps of the plantations it certifies. This makes social control on compliance with both the law and the certification criteria impossible.
Impacts on water availability and quality Fast growing pulpwood plantations use vast amounts of water and often impact the availability of water for other uses, such as subsistence farming, agriculture or even drinking water. Though the industry stresses that eucalyptus tree uses water efficiently and that its water use is similar to that of other plants on the basis of biomass produced (282 grams of water per gram of dry biomass according to one study), since these trees grow very fast they actually use much more water per hectare per year than slow-growing native vegetation.
Long term research in South Africa has shown that the fast growing and exotic eucalyptus trees require, on average, 30 liters of water per day. When planted at a density of 400 trees per hectare, this means 12,000 liters per hectare per day. This may cause water levels in nearby streams and wells, as well as the groundwater levels, to drop.
Apart from the direct use of water by the trees themselves, there is also the impact from water being taken from rivers for irrigation purposes, the reduced uptake of water by soils due to erosion and the destruction of rivers and streams when the land is being prepared for plantations. Complaints of water scarcity by communities that live near plantations are numerous, whether in the Baixo Parnaíba, in Espírito Santo or in Três Lagoas.
On top of the high water usage of the pulp industry, it also pollutes waterways, both due to the excessive use of agrochemicals and due to the discharge of polluted effluent in waterways. The effluent of Eldorado’s pulp mills contains, among other things, carcinogenic dioxins, as it uses chlorine in the bleaching process.
Energy production The Vanguard complex also has a power plant which produces up to 220 megawatts (MW) per hour. The plant runs on biomass, burning timber that isn't used in the pulp process. Of this amount, 95MW is used by the mill, and another 50MW by the companies that produced inputs. The rest, which is enough to supply a city with one million inhabitants, is sold to the national grid. The project for the Vanguard II mill includes another 310MW biomass energy plant, which will produce energy excess of 92MW. NGO's have warned that the large scale burning of woody biomass to generate energy is bad for the climate, for the people, for the forests and for the energy transition.
Corruption The Batista brothers, who control J&F Investments, are engulfed in corruption scandals. On 13 May 2017, J&F Investimentos SA agreed to pay BRL 10.3 billion (USD 3.16 billion) over 25 years as part of a leniency settlement over bribery allegations which are investigated under Operation Car Wash. Its the world’s biggest leniency fine ever levied, Brazilian prosecutors said.
Another investigation, Operation Greenfield, investigates a billionaire corruption scheme that was set up between 2009 and 2015, in which ex-executives of pension funds Petros and Funcef, knowingly invested millions in an over-rated Eldorado Brasil, in exchange for kickbacks, but in detriment of the pension funds.
Paper Excellence, the company that was previously in line to purchase Eldorado Brasil, is controlled by the Widjaja family, which also controls APP. This company was dissacociated from FSC in 2007 for its involvement in destructive forestry practices, and in 2001 defaulted on USD 14 billion of debt.

On top of the high water usage of the pulp industry, it also pollutes waterways, both due to the excessive use of agrochemicals and due to the discharge of polluted effluent in waterways. The effluent of Eldorado’s pulp mills contains, among other things, carcinogenic dioxins, as it uses chlorine in the bleaching process. Energy production The Vanguard complex also has a power plant which produces up to 220 megawatts (MW) per hour. The plant runs on biomass, burning timber that isn't used in the pulp process. Of this amount, 95MW is used by the mill, and another 50MW by the companies that produced inputs. The rest, which is enough to supply a city with one million inhabitants, is sold to the national grid. The project for the Vanguard II mill includes another 310MW biomass energy plant, which will produce energy excess of 92MW. NGO's have warned that the large scale burning of woody biomass to generate energy is bad for the climate, for the people, for the forests and for the energy transition. Corruption The Batista brothers, who control J&F Investments, are engulfed in corruption scandals. On 13 May 2017, J&F Investimentos SA agreed to pay BRL 10.3 billion (USD 3.16 billion) over 25 years as part of a leniency settlement over bribery allegations which are investigated under Operation Car Wash. Its the world’s biggest leniency fine ever levied, Brazilian prosecutors said. Another investigation, Operation Greenfield, investigates a billionaire corruption scheme that was set up between 2009 and 2015, in which ex-executives of pension funds Petros and Funcef, knowingly invested millions in an over-rated Eldorado Brasil, in exchange for kickbacks, but in detriment of the pension funds. Paper Excellence, the company that was previously in line to purchase Eldorado Brasil, is controlled by the Widjaja family, which also controls APP. This company was dissacociated from FSC in 2007 for its involvement in destructive forestry practices, and in 2001 defaulted on USD 14 billion of debt. https://www.banktrack.org/blog/two_sides_of_the_same_coin_how_the_pulp_and_paper_industry_is_profiting_from_deforestation_in_the_amazon_rainforest_1;;;Community shares in the investment project;;Community shares in the investment project;;;;;;;;;#current####Eucalyptus;;;;;;;;;;;;;;China;;Austria;;United States of America;;The company mainly exports its pulp, 40% of which is destined for Asia.;No;;The company owns an industrial complex in Três Lagoas, which includes a pulp mill, chemical plants, a biomass-based power plant.;;No;;Surface water|River;;;;;;;;;;No;;

Fibre Sourcing The establishment of large monocultures is very detrimental to biodiversity and the conservation of valuable biomes. Eldorado Brasil has a landbank of 350,000 hectares in Mato Grosso do Sul, of which 220,000 hectares are eucalyptus plantations. Eldorado claims it has an area of 106,000 hectares of preserved forests. However, the company does not provide geo-referenced maps of the areas it owns, leases or sources from. And though over 90% of its landbank is FSC-certified, FSC also does not disclose geo-referenced maps of the plantations it certifies. This makes social control on compliance with both the law and the certification criteria impossible. Impacts on water availability and quality Fast growing pulpwood plantations use vast amounts of water and often impact the availability of water for other uses, such as subsistence farming, agriculture or even drinking water. Though the industry stresses that eucalyptus tree uses water efficiently and that its water use is similar to that of other plants on the basis of biomass produced (282 grams of water per gram of dry biomass according to one study), since these trees grow very fast they actually use much more water per hectare per year than slow-growing native vegetation. Long term research in South Africa has shown that the fast growing and exotic eucalyptus trees require, on average, 30 liters of water per day. When planted at a density of 400 trees per hectare, this means 12,000 liters per hectare per day. This may cause water levels in nearby streams and wells, as well as the groundwater levels, to drop.

And though over 90% of its landbank is FSC-certified, FSC also does not disclose geo-referenced maps of the plantations it certifies. This makes social control on compliance with both the law and the certification criteria impossible. Impacts on water availability and quality Fast growing pulpwood plantations use vast amounts of water and often impact the availability of water for other uses, such as subsistence farming, agriculture or even drinking water. Though the industry stresses that eucalyptus tree uses water efficiently and that its water use is similar to that of other plants on the basis of biomass produced (282 grams of water per gram of dry biomass according to one study), since these trees grow very fast they actually use much more water per hectare per year than slow-growing native vegetation. Long term research in South Africa has shown that the fast growing and exotic eucalyptus trees require, on average, 30 liters of water per day. When planted at a density of 400 trees per hectare, this means 12,000 liters per hectare per day. This may cause water levels in nearby streams and wells, as well as the groundwater levels, to drop. Apart from the direct use of water by the trees themselves, there is also the impact from water being taken from rivers for irrigation purposes, the reduced uptake of water by soils due to erosion and the destruction of rivers and streams when the land is being prepared for plantations. Complaints of water scarcity by communities that live near plantations are numerous, whether in the Baixo Parnaíba, in Espírito Santo or in Três Lagoas. On top of the high water usage of the pulp industry, it also pollutes waterways, both due to the excessive use of agrochemicals and due to the discharge of polluted effluent in waterways. The effluent of Eldorado’s pulp mills contains, among other things, carcinogenic dioxins, as it uses chlorine in the bleaching process. Energy production The Vanguard complex also has a power plant which produces up to 220 megawatts (MW) per hour. The plant runs on biomass, burning timber that isn't used in the pulp process. Of this amount, 95MW is used by the mill, and another 50MW by the companies that produced inputs. The rest, which is enough to supply a city with one million inhabitants, is sold to the national grid. The project for the Vanguard II mill includes another 310MW biomass energy plant, which will produce energy excess of 92MW. NGO's have warned that the large scale burning of woody biomass to generate energy is bad for the climate, for the people, for the forests and for the energy transition. Corruption The Batista brothers, who control J&F Investments, are engulfed in corruption scandals. On 13 May 2017, J&F Investimentos SA agreed to pay BRL 10.3 billion (USD 3.16 billion) over 25 years as part of a leniency settlement over bribery allegations which are investigated under Operation Car Wash. Its the world’s biggest leniency fine ever levied, Brazilian prosecutors said. Another investigation, Operation Greenfield, investigates a billionaire corruption scheme that was set up between 2009 and 2015, in which ex-executives of pension funds Petros and Funcef, knowingly invested millions in an over-rated Eldorado Brasil, in exchange for kickbacks, but in detriment of the pension funds. Paper Excellence, the company that was previously in line to purchase Eldorado Brasil, is controlled by the Widjaja family, which also controls APP. This company was dissacociated from FSC in 2007 for its involvement in destructive forestry practices, and in 2001 defaulted on USD 14 billion of debt. https://www.banktrack.org/blog/two_sides_of_the_same_coin_how_the_pulp_and_paper_industry_is_profiting_from_deforestation_in_the_amazon_rainforest_1;;;Community shares in the investment project;;Community shares in the investment project;;;;;;;;;#current####Eucalyptus;;;;;;;;;;;;;;China;;Austria;;United States of America;;The company mainly exports its pulp, 40% of which is destined for Asia.;No;;The company owns an industrial complex in Três Lagoas, which includes a pulp mill, chemical plants, a biomass-based power plant.;;No;;Surface water|River;;;;;;;;;;No;;

As an alternative, the district identified Adiri community land near the established scheme that the clan members are reluctant to offer on suspicion that the government intends to grab the community land.
The community has raised concerns about the amount of land sought for the project, which would leave them
with limited use for their own agricultural and other needs. The community consented to offering 365 acres
(equivalent to 145 hectares) for the project but later realized that the project would actually take up 365 hectares
of their land. The community feel that they were deliberately misled regarding the amount of land needed, and
therefore no longer trust the project implementers";;;;;;;;;Socio-economic|Eviction|Violence;"On August 10, 2021, sixteen members of Paten Clan, a community in Pakwach District in northern Uganda, were shot at and wounded by local police and army officers, as a retaliation for their opposition to the Wadelai irrigation project .Staff of the construction company in charge of implementing the project, together with representatives of the local authorities and the police, forcefully entered the community. When communities questioned and protested against the trespass, the local police and members of the Uganda People’s Defence Force (UPDF) started firing bullets and teargas to disperse them. 16 community members were injure.

The day after, UPDF officers arrested and beat up four women, including one pregnant woman, while they were on their way to fetch water. These attacks are just the latest example of the ongoing retaliations faced by community members and human rights defenders in Pakwach District, who are being targeted for their opposition to the government’s acquisition of their land for agricultural production under the Wadelai Irrigation Project that they are concerned will impact their livelihoods and way of life.Nine members of the community have also been criminalised following the protests. They have been accused of
sabotaging the project by local police and are currently out on bail.

The clan and community members argue that the land in question is an identity of the entire Paten clan members from which they derive their livelihood by grazing animals, laying bricks, and excavating sand for building houses. In the several unfruitful dialogue meetings with the community in Wadelai, the majority of the clan members have distanced themselves from a list containing forty-seven members purporting to have consented to the giveaway to the government to fulfill the extension project.";;;;;Productive infrastructure (e.g. irrigation, tractors, machinery...);;On September 9, a group of organizations that are members of the Coalition for Human Rights in Development and other allies sent an open letter to the African Development Bank and the Nordic Development Fund, calling on them to take immediate actions to address reprisals against a community in Uganda impacted by the Wadelai irrigation project;;;;;;;#current####Cotton, Rice;;;;;;;;;;Yes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Yes;;;;;;;Yes;;;;;No;;

Estos pequeños propietarios, quienes representan la mayoría de las hectáreas en renta en el parque eólico Piedra Larga  Fase 1, denuncian principalmente tanto una violación básica de sus derechos como pueblo indígena, como la de sus derechos a una consulta previa, libre e informada, algo que nunca sucedió entre 2009 y 2010 cuando se firmaron los contratos de arrendamiento. A partir de esta violación inicial, se han dado otra serie de violaciones, afectaciones ambientales y recientemente represiones violentas a manos de caciques y agentes de la empresa Demex.

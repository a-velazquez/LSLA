It stated that this land grab violated the local population’s rights to life and self-determination, including their right to manage and benefit from natural resources and the right to development. This was the first trans-boundary case accepted by the NHRCT, setting a legal precedent on the Commission’s jurisdiction. The report found that KSL is responsible for human rights violations due to its decision to receive and benefit from the land concession that resulted in these violations, even if the company did not itself commit the abuses.

land. Affected farmers can no longer grow enough food to sustain their families. Many have sold their cows because they have nowhere for them to graze.

Crops have been destroyed that local farmers have been cultivating for years, including cashew, tamarind, and mango trees.

Company guards have shot or confiscated animals, including buffalo and cows.

Chemical waste from the plantation has poisoned local water sources and killed fish, which is the main source of protein for surrounding communities.

Children have been pulled out of school in order to work for their struggling families.

Company staff prevent local people from going into the forest to collect forest by-products, or sometimes charge a fee to do so, which represents a significant loss of livelihood.

Some people who lost all their land have had no choice but to work on the plantations. The pay is low and the work is irregular. Before they can work for the company, people must also agree to drop any claims for compensation.

Further comments are inspired from a study by researchers of the University of Groningen about the principal economic caracteristics of tropical forestry funds. They apply to the cases that concern investment funds in ""sustainable forestry"". These cases manifest the apparition in the late 1990s of mutual funds investing in tree plantations, above all in Brazil, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Ghana, Panama, Paraguay, Poland and Portugal. What made investments in tropical forest funds beneficial despite the ""illiquidity"" of tree plantations (return on 20 years) was the construction of markets for certified wood products (predominantly for teakwood), carbon trading and other eco-services payments. Now, according to the analysis, this type of investment in ""sustainable forestry"" doesn't appear anymore like profitable enough  (in part because of funds management's costs) and as too risky (in part because of teakwood price' fluctuations). Funds are often linked between them.A lot of them are opaque in their structure and funcioning, and some of them fraudulent (operating without licences).

An indigenous organisation constituted itself against the wind energy projects in the Tehuantepec Isthmus, called Asamblea de los Pueblos Indígenas del Istmo de Tehuantepec en Defensa de la Tierra y el Territorio (APIITDTT).

They are opposed to unfair land lease contracts to spanish companies, and above all to mexican federal and state governments that promote this projects and repress protests. They say that the installation of windmills, which need to inject a lot of ciment into the soil (each one consuming almost 1/2 ha) have very negative impacts on local agriculture, destructing drainage and irrigation collective infrastructures, and threaten fragile ecosystems (mangrove swamps, low forest). The conflict is increasing now (see the communiqués, cell AS).

To date, Atama has begun clear felling forests for roads and an oil palm nursery in one area of 5,000 hectares at Epoma in Sangha, while a second 5,000 hectare section of forest in the concession in Cuvette has also been signed off for logging and clearance. These areas overlap with a national park and a Ramsar site. The company has not finished clearing these sites (2017). 
400ha planted between March and June 2013. Planting rate targeted is 5000ha per annum. The planting will occur in ten phases, over a 15 year period. The goal was to have 2000ha planted by the 1st quarter in 2015. Unlikely that the company will reach their goal of 180 000ha planted- timber extraction occurring more rapidly than planting of seedlings.

Nyerere and Kim Il Sung through a Tanzanian-North Korean government joint venture (KOTACO). KOTACO surveyed the farm, cleared the property, built 185 km of roads and approximately 290 km of drainage ditches, and started to produce rice on approximately 2,500 ha. After investing over $25 million in the unfinished project, KOTACO was liquidated in 1993, leaving the farm and its equipment with RUBADA.  In 1999, the Mngeta farm was contracted to Kilombero Holding Company (KIHOCO). KIHOCO was never able to commence production on more than 400 ha, and after falling five years behind in rent payments, it was forced off the farm.

At least 230 household members were affected- 80 lost their homes and farming land, while only 150 lost their land.;;;"KPL embarked on the process of removing villagers from the project area by preparing a
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The RAP stated: compensation payments for the loss of crops and fences; construction of new settlement areas and houses; and the provision of
alternative farming plots. The resettlement and compensation process undertaken has been widely commended and the company is often regarded as a role model for agricultural investors. However, reports suggest that the compensation program is fraught with contention. The development of the project has had an inflationary effect on the local land market, which makes it highly difficult for locals to rent agricultural land today. As part of the resettlement plan for the 80 households, which lost both houses and farming land, KPL indicated that it would construct new residential houses and auxiliaries at new settlement sites.

However, long before the privatization, villagers had already moved in the then unutilised estate since in the early 1990s when Nafco was slowly dying; they settled in the area. State managers decided to rent out the farmland and machinery to private farmers, to use the rent income to keep the infrastructure up and running and to pay the staff. From 1997 to 2005, the NAFCO management stopped having any role in production and limited itself to repairing and managing the irrigation infrastructure, managing the farm as a paternalistic landlord. Since
1997, tenant farmers started running the estate by renting six-hectare plots. The organisation
of production changed dramatically, as rice farming on the estate was demechanised, by
employing wage workers in place of agricultural machinery. This caused a rapid, significant
increase of wage labor, and migrant workers flocked to the area. In 2004, the government announced the imminent privatisation of NAFCO-Kapunga.
NAFCO tenant farmers established a cooperative society – the Chimala Agricultural and Marketing Cooperative. They then demanded that the government sell Kapunga Rice Farm to their coop.

""A critical juncture was reached when Feronia filed for bank-ruptcy in August of 2020.

In April 2021,  African Centre for Biodiversity (ACB), an environmental watchdog, said the South African government’s involvement in PHC was highly inappropriate: “The bottom line here is that GEPF has invested the money of South African workers to entrench dispossession of peoples’ territories and colonial patterns of land ownership and power in the DRC,” said ACB’s executive director Mariam Mayet.

Evlin Kuyek, researcher at GRAIN mentioned that Before KCM assumed control over the plantations, several European development banks held the majority of shares in PHC through Feronia and invested over US$150 million in the company from 2013 to 2020. When Feronia filed for bankruptcy in 2020, the development banks agreed to pass the assets they held in PHC to a private equity fund controlled by the KCM for a cash payment of US$500,000 and agreed to write off large portions of their remaining debt.

In Sierra Leona for RSPO certification, Malen Radio broadcasted information about the audit two weeks before the audit in September 2020. One community leader stated he was informed by a company liaison officer who visited the communities 5 days in advance. Some civil society groups said they received notice 3 to 5 days in advance, while others were not notified at all. Civil society organisations from Pujehun district said they did not receive a formal invitation or agenda, which made it difficult to prepare. A second audit took place in early November 2020, according to SCS,2 because they were unable to process all stakeholder comments from the first audit or meet with newly identified stakeholders. SCS did not reach out proactively to international and national civil society organisations to prepare and inform the audits, despite publicly available reports, media statements and other communication about SAC and Socfin as well as news items on Socfin and Bolloré SLAPP suits against those organisations and individuals. Even though their internal communication shows that SCS was well aware of the controversial nature of the company and the high credibility risk.
An important stakeholder group called the Malen Affected Land Owners and Land Users Association (MALOA) stated they were not properly consulted.Although several leaders met informally with one of the auditors, their proposal for a proper consultation meeting with MALOA members was not agreed to by the auditors, reportedly because of security concerns. One company representative confirmed to the researcher that SCS had to return for a second field audit because several stakeholders were not consulted, including MALOA. However, even during that second visit, the auditors failed to consult MALOA. MALOA leaders also stated that the list of stakeholders the company provided to the auditors was heavily biased towards its proponents.";Rejection;according to Green Scenery, corruption and pressure was applied on land-owners and town chiefs to sign agreements.the establishment of the company has met with significant resistance from the local population. People from several communities affected by the SAC lease area have formed the Malen Affected Landowners Association (MALOA) to defend the rights of landowners and land users. Several individual landowners have also sent official complaints about tree-crop and oil palm plantations that SAC destroyed, allegedly without their permission, to the senior district officer and other local authorities.There have been several confrontations in the area between SAC surveyors and heavy equipment operators and local people protesting SAC intrusion on their lands, some of which have led to arrests. In December 2012, more than 100 aggrieved landowners and users met in Pujehun and signed a resolution calling for the Human Rights Commission to intervene on their behalf and saying they would no longer permit Socfin personnel or machines on their land. On 9th December 2013, another protest was held by the elders to allow people to again express their grievances to the Paramount Chief over the lease of land. Hundreds were waiting in the village of Libby Malen for the chiefdom authorities to arrive when they learned that nine of their fellow villagers had been beaten and arrested by the police en route to the meeting.The rest of the villages fled from the protest spot immediately but were confronted with an armed contingent of police who fired tear gas and live bullets into the crowd, leaving many people with serious injuries. After continuous complaints government, the villagers are still not heard. The local communities have protested against Bollore within the wider protests against the company. 5 Landowners have been found guilty by a high court in Southern Sierra Leone after they were allegedly found guilty of damaging the plantation- prison for 5 months or a fine of $5,100 each. The company claims that they obtained consent from the community and followed the procedures laid out in the law.

MALOA members and leaders stated they have not been properly consulted. Therefore, it is likely that the
auditors did not take into account their evidence on land disputes. Their grievances include: landowners were sidelined
during lease agreement negotiations, FPIC was not respected, physical land demarcation disappeared, some
families have lost all their land, lands were taken without due compensation, right to food is undermined, the
annual lease payments are too low and the payment method is not inclusive, alternative livelihoods are not
available and employment is too low, and communities are separated because the company changed roads.

According to The ex-president Ernest Bai Koroma of the last All People’s Congress (APC) the first protest against the land grabbing by Socfin in 2011 was violently repressed, forty people were arrested by the police and fifteen were pursued in court. In 2012, fourothers were arrested because they opposed the survey team of Socfin. In 2013, another fifteen people were arrested and detained. In 2014, six leaders of MALOA were arbitrarily arrested and pursued in court. Following a partial trial, they were in prison for several months; in 2015 another eleven people were arrested. In 2019, the tensions led to a conflict on the plantation that left two people dead and eighteen MALOA activists arrested,sometimes beaten and arbitrarily detained for several weeks.

evidence-based statements or writings.”

ES";The General Manager of Socfin, Gerben Haringsma assured the Government of Sierra Leone and the people of Malen Chiefdom that the Company would live up to their corporate social responsibilities including the construction of a resident hospital, network of roads, schools, housing facilities, job opportunities for 10,000 people with special preference given to natives of the chiefdom. Moreover he promised that full payment would be made for existing plantations in the areas of operations to be followed by an annual payment of lease rents to land owners. According to Green Scenery, it is not clear what formula will be used in the distribution of the land lease payment between District Council, administration, national government and land-owners. Socfin originally offered US$220 per hectare as a one-off payment for the land, but this offer was rejected for being very low compared to the real value. Apparently the communities were paid a $40 000 for rent in 2011. The NGO Maloa protests since 2011 against the conditions under which an affiliate of the group settled on his land. Five of its members were jailed for two weeks and will be judged on November 15 2013 for destroying plants palm oil. Socfin now pays $12.50 per hectare per year to community members (2017).

On 4 February 2016, following a lengthy legal process, all six of the MALOA executive members were convicted and ordered to pay heavy fines or face six months imprisonment. In 2017, MALOA and Green Scenery approached the Government for the resumption of the dialogue process. Affected communities continue to demand an independent investigation, deeming it a prerequisite for the establishment of an impartial and effective resolution mechanism. On 6th November, the Executive Committee and the general membership of Malen Affected Land Owners Association (MALOA), expressed their dissatisfaction with the RSPO process and specifically the refusal of the SCS Global Services Audit Team to hold an open General Meeting at Sahn Malen Court Barray. The President made a solemn promise in 2018 to the hard-pressed aggrieved land owners and the people of the chiefdom, that he will resolve the festering land dispute between them and the palm oil producer. ""Green Scenery believes that the conflict resolution process should consider the renegotiation of irregular land lease agreements, and take into account the negative impact of the company’s activities on the rights of Malen citizens, including environmental impact and implementation plans, criminalization, compensation and indemnification.""

In November 2020, several civil society actors filed a complaint with SCS, alleging violation of RSPO’s standard for Certification Systems. SCS informed complainants5 that confidentiality during the complaints process cannot be guaranteed.

The report and work by Oxfam around these land acquisitions allowed the identification of more than 50000 hectares that belong to the subsidiaries created by the american company to surround Colombian legislation. In spite of this fact, by considering the area included in those plots that present monoculture close to Cargill holdings, the total area would account for almost one hundred thousand hectares.;#current##Food crops, Non-food agricultural commodities;Due to the controversy linked to this case, the managers of Cargill and its subsidiares argued that the intention of the investment is to produce the cereals that Colombia has to import to satisfy its domestic demand. The goal of this produce is to satisfy demand for human consumption and animal feeds.;Outright purchase;"There is a huge controversy regarding this deal, or those deals, in fact. According to Colombian legislation valid by the time of the land acquisition (Ley 160 de 1994), it is not allowed to accumulate land that was allocated by the State which exceeds the limit of an Unidad Agrícola Familiar (UAF - Familiar Agricultural Unit). The size of this unit might vary depending on soil quality, infrastructure, access to markets, etc. The idea is that one UAF should be enough for a landless or poor rural family to acquire a minimal social welfare with the context inherent to the place where they obtain the land. To overcome this ""limitation"", Cargill, by means of its subsidiaries Black River Asses Management, Cargill Trading Colombia, Cargill de Colombia and Colombia Agro, created a private company for any holding to be acquired a few months previous to the land transaction and these will make a long-term rent agreement with Cargill subsidiaries. After this all happened, the private companies created by Cargill were liquidated. These proceeding was advised by the law firm Brigard & Urrutia, which had already done the same with other cases.

Since law 160 of 1994 specifies that no person or company can own more than an UAF that was previously allocated intentionally to poor peasants, it is up to anybody to define whether this procedure was legal or not to acquire the land. For some this move was unethical, but not illegal. Up until now, the judiciary system has done nothing regarding this case.

Although Oxfam in a report special on this topic argued that it seemed that no violence was involved on this land deal, the portal ""Rutas del Conflicto"" argues that some of the land holdings were bought to the initial owners by paramilitary leaders, hence being possibly related to drug trafficking, extortion or money laundering.

1. There are over 7,000 trees that have been marked to be cut down
2. The land marked for the hotel project blocks the elephant corridor between the Uda Walawa National Park and Bogahapittiya sanctuary. If the project proceeds, the elephants would be forced to enter villages resulting in a massive human-elephant conflict.
3. It is prime forest territory, with savannah grasslands inhabited by elephant, bear, sambhur, and other animals. Precious tropical deciduous forestland in Bogahapattiya is threatened by developers. If the golf course project go through, Sri Lanka will lose considerable area of an extremely biodiverse forest.
4. Loss of vegetation caused by deforestation leads to soil erosion and run-off. The silted water ends up in the Weli Oya reservoir, which irrigates more than 3,000 acres of paddy land and feeds 27 small tanks.
5. The forest feeds two streams that enter the Weli Oya, which in turn feeds into the Walawe. After implementing the project these streams will dry off, creating a huge water problem in the area. The entire area is a hugely important watershed for populations downstream. The land selected for the golf course comes right up to where the two streams, including the Demata Ara, join up with the Weli Oya at a small dam. Construction work on the intended golf course will disrupt the Weli Oya irrigation system. Thousands of families depend on agriculture based on the waters of the Weli Oya.
6. In order to maintain the golf course in good condition, water and the fertilizer urea as well as pesticides should be used in large quantities. Aluminum compounds should be applied to the field in order to enhance binding of soil particles and prevent soil erosion. These chemicals will finally accumulate in the tanks irrigated by the Weli Oya Irrigation Project. That will be harmful to existing faunal and floral diversity.
7. An extensive study has been carried out on the vertebrate diversity of the Bogahapattiya-Soragune-Samanala Wewa Forest Area by Mr. L.J. Mendis Wickramasinghe of the Herpetological Foundation of Sri Lanka. The unpublished report, ‘A Vertebrate Faunal Survey of Samanala Wewa, Towards Declaration as a Wildlife National Park’ identifies around 390 species from 5 vertebrate families. Out of that, 59 are endemic to Sri Lanka. Around 40% of the total number of vertebrate species and 19% of the endemic vertebrate species in the country are found in the area, according to the report. A number of extremely rare species and also several new species have been recorded from the forest.

(Ethiopia Branch);Ethiopia;Private company;;;;Suri#;Dizi#;;;;Not consulted;Dizi tribe came to the village and told the Suri community that the land has been given to the company. The Dizi tribe have received tax from the government and the plantation. The Dizi tribe collaborate with the foreigners and encroach on the Suri land. On February 11, 2012 the company came with a GPS and demarcated the land they had been allocated. They told the  Suri people that they must leave this village. On April 29th, 2012 the government went with soldiers and for two week tried to prevent the Suri from planting crops. This was to force the community to accept moving into the resettlement site. In one village near the Malaysian plantation, three houses were burned downed, with money, gold and grain stores inside. This was done by the plantation workers.;Rejection;Initially thought it was a good development, then realised they loose their land and water. Heavy military presence (to stop community members from grazing their cattle on the land and stealing the crops)  and some people have died in protests. Every bulldozer operated by a Malaysian plantation company is now guarded by several soldiers. This follows the alleged killing of 17 people near the plantation in October 2012. The Suri people fought the government with guns, resulting in a retaliation by the police, killing 65 community members. Suri members have been imprisoned, during which time the Dizi community members were allowed into the prisons to beat the Suri members up. Heavily armed soldiers were deployed in the region.;;;Yes;;;;;;;Villagers lost their grazing and crop land, as well as access to water for their cattle. Members were intimidated to move to the resettlement site through the threat of arrest and violence, the conditional distribution of food aid, and the cutting off of resources, particularly grazing land and water to sustain pastoral livelihoods. The increase in violent clashes between the Suri and Dizi can be linked to the intrusion of the Koka plantation and displacement of Suri. Important grazing lands are now unavailable to the Suri while the community has been subject to a resettlement plan. In addition large scale plantations in the area have disturbed political order between the Suri and other local ethnic groups, escalating violent conflicts. Suri people were killed in a fight between Dizi and Suri people because some Suri villages were moved by the government.

En 2011 una comisión de personas afectadas comenzaron a reunirse y organizar un estudio de los impactos de las plantaciones de árboles en el municipio de Imbau. En 2013 se organizó un gran seminario en Imbau para presentar los resultados. El resultado fue un mapa social de los impactos, incluyendo el éxodo rural y el confinamiento de las comunidades, los impactos culturales, la escasez de agua y los impactos sobre la soberanía alimentaria, el empobrecimiento del suelo y la biodiversidad.
Resultado del conflicto / respuesta: Al final del seminario organizado por la comisión de las personas afectadas, una propuesta de ley fue presentado al Ayuntamiento para restringir y organizar la ubicación y la expansión de las plantaciones en el municipio.

From its inception, NedOil was built with an inclusive mindset.  It was originally set up with the objective to generate funds to cover the operational costs of the local hospital in Tonkolili District, also set up by the Lion Heart Foundation.  Additionally, this model provided direct and indirect employment and thus income for the communities in and around Yele.  With the local communities already growing oil palm on small plantations, it made sense to set up a mill and buy palm fruit directly from the local farmers. After operating NedOil for a few years, it was not generating the necessary funds to support the hospital. In order to keep it a viable operation and ensure continuity, Lion Heart Foundation had to find an investor for NedOil. In 2014, NHSL (Natural Habitat Sierra Leone) acquired full ownership of NedOil.

In 2012 the company sold the lands to Wilmar International, illegally according to the villagers. The villagers now have three basic demands: the existing plantation must be operated as a partnership; there can be no expansion beyond the areas that have already been cleared for planting; and, the government must identify and provide the village with an alternative area of land of equal size where they can farm. The villagers state that Wilmar attempted to consult the villagers once the land had been purchased, however this was largely viewed as not genuine by the community.

Torino estaría a cargo de la administración de la finca utilizada para ingresar cocaína al país. Los pequeños productores de la región fueron amenazados por los narcos quienes cortaron los caminos vecinales impidiéndoles el paso a sus campos. En septiembre de 2016, fue asesinada Liliana Ledesma, una pobladora del lugar. Castedo había sido señalado como el autor intelectual. El crimen estuvo motivado por las molestias que la productora rural ocasionaba a los narcos. Se quejaba y denunciaba de forma pública cómo se cerraban los caminos a Bolivia a favor de los narcos.

Therefore the two villages (Moulandafoula and Guidouma) objected to the proposed development of Lot 2.
Almost all villages expressed their concern on the loss of customary rights and livelihoods, particularly with respect to land for village farming and wanted the company to respect these by the identification and setting aside of areas for village use and/or compensation through material means that contribute towards social development.
Due to strong dependence on rivers and other water bodies for fishing, drinking water and bathing, many villages expressed concern of the use of phyto-sanitary (agrochemical) products by the company and consequent contamination of water bodies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Jobs;;;;State;The land subject to the lease belongs to the State;Shifting cultivation|Hunting/Gathering|Forestry;Customary use by villages: Shifting agriculture is the primary activity in the villages with women carrying out planting, weeding and harvesting and men, land clearing .

beans, maize, sweet potatoes, bananas, groundnuts, cassava and mangoes, and they kept pigs, goats and
cows. Now, large chunks of land are covered with sugarcane, coffee, soya and maize which are all solely for

The communities plagued by the continued forced evictions comprise three categories: The first category consists of people who were born on the land since 1935; the second, those that settled on the land during and after civil wars, including the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) which lasted for 2 decades in Northern Uganda from the late 1990s; and lastly, those who settled on the eviction site at the instance of government in 2011 through the Nyamalebe Landless Association.

in September 2021,it was reported that Kiryandongo Sugar Company Limited, has taken advantage of the situation to brutalize, humiliate and forcefully evict locals off their land to pave way for sugarcane growing.The latest case since the suspension involves over 13 (thirteen) families that have been forced off their land by the government’s army, without adequate, prompt, and fair compensation while knowing that the government had floored their would-be protector. One of the local council leaders who visited some eviction scenes on condition of anonymity said that companies’ forced evictions in the area are surging with the protection of the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces (UPDF) attached to the 4th Division of the government’s army. The leader said the evictions are rendering people homeless, and this has been exacerbated by COVID-19 which the land grabbers have always taken advantage of.";Socio-economic|Eviction|Displacement|Violence;"An estimated 35,000 people are being evicted to make way for these three plantation projects  (Kiryandongo Sugar Limited, Great Season SMC Limited and  Agilis Partners).
The health of the workers and local people are also impacted by the heavy use of agrochemicals on the
plantations as well as the burning of sugarcane. Local residents say that nothing is done to protect them or
forewarn them when crops are being sprayed or being burned. 
Several local schools have closed because the children can no longer access them.
Victims of forced land eviction accuse the group of land brokers of perpetrating violence through hiring and using machete-wielding men, private security guards, and police officers attached to Kiryandongo district police to commit violent acts which include: sexual and gender-based violence, illegal arrest and detention, torture, kidnap, demolition of houses, cutting down their food crops, and stealing their household properties among others.

arrangements and new partnerships to increase the number of farmers enrolled. Among others, the Milky Way Partnership programme was scaled up through its participation in the public private DAMAU Household Milk Farm Project with Kaduna State Government with the aim of settling 1,000 farm households in a 9,000 hectare area by providing infrastructure and three imported cows for each farmer.

In this case, women do not benefit fully from individual land titling. Women may also exercise their land rights through informal and customary ownership. Men are privileged to benefit from the state regulation of land titling. Although both women and men have access to informal land market, women are favored in negotiations. This channel becomes a viable option for women than engaging the state and relying on land titling to provide them access to land. Market engagement gives more flexibility for women’s land claims than what state regulation offers them. Women may exercise autonomy in negotiating and transacting with other parties to buy land, rent out their land, or use land as loan collateral without the husband’s consent. Decision making based on asset ownership and the household’s economic need rather than gender also allows both women and men to benefit from the income derived from the land. However, there is also evidence that this may disadvantage women. San Mariano’s case demonstrates that women farmers may be incorporated into corporate agriculture in ways that threaten their rights to land. At the same time, however, they are able to maneuver and utilize non-state spaces to claim and retain their effective control over land, contrary to the largely negative outcomes experienced in other cases of land deals.""

Later, the government accused the foundation of breaching contract as the core farm sold high volumes of staple crops to downstream customers. This business activity conflicted with the NGO status of the farm and led the foundation to suddenly withdraw all funding. The same withdrawal was further paralleled by stark losses of grants and contributions to the Clinton Foundation after Hillary Clinton lost the US general elections against Donald Trump.

Settled families suffer from the spraying of agrochemicals carried out by Umoe Bioenergy S.A., so that the cultivation of food crops by peasant families is directly affected.

In fieldwork carried out in 2012 and 2014, the families of the Guarani settlement claim that livestock was impacted, the little cattle that the settlers had was dying because the pasture was frequently contaminated by pesticides. Also due to this spraying, there were no more bees in the settlement, which further helps in the loss of production. Thus, it is an environmental, food, economic and social impact. At the same time, at least in 2012, part of the plant's workers were settled, reflecting a proletarianization of rural workers.

Another point that is important to highlight is that Umoe Bioenergy S.A. is located in Pontal do Paranapanema, west of the state of São Paulo, a region known for intense land conflicts, resulting from the large amount of illegal land, that is, land that belonged to the who had falsified property titles after the Land Law of 1850, enabling the formation of countless latifundios. In fieldwork on June 3, 2014, a camp of the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST) was found on a dirt road between the sugar cane plantations of Umoe Bioenergy SA and the former Odebrecht (currently Atvos, since the company changed its corporate name), between the municipalities of Teodoro Sampaio and Mirante do Paranapanema, however, only the area occupied by Umoe Bioenergy S.A. was claimed by the MST.

The camp was called Sister Dorothy at that time. According to the campers present at the site during the fieldwork, they had been camped in the area since January 15, 2014. They started the camp with 45 families from the Irmã Goreti camp, in Marabá Paulista (SP), but on June 3 of 2014 at Sister Dorothy camp there were 22 families. According to the campers, they were in the area because the Land Institute of the State of São Paulo (ITESP), said that this would be a possible settlement area, however, so far, nothing had been declared. The campers reported impacts from aerial spraying carried out on the sugarcane plantation, which contaminates bodies of water near the camp.

The field work took place during the scientific initiation research (2012 to 2014) developed during the undergraduate course in Geography, at the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), which resulted in the monograph (course completion work) “O processo de estrangeirização da terra no Brasil: o estudo de caso da Umoe Bioenergy, Sandovalina (SP)"", defended and published in March 2015.

In this area, the analytical objective is to provide an evaluation of the regional insertion of the enterprise considered within a radius of 3 km from each margin of the external access road, in order to verify and monitor the possible occurrence of erosion processes, interference due to noise, particulate matter and fauna migration, resulting from the passage of vehicles used to implement the wind turbines.

The main characteristic of the pasture fund is the coexistence of areas for individual use and areas for collective use. In other words, there is the use of part of the land individually (housing, raising small animals and growing fruit trees) and also the collective use for the creation of animals.";;;;;;"On September 20, 2021, the residents of Comunidade de Fundo e Fecho de Pasto Fazenda Quina blocked the road that gives access to the Morrinhos Wind Farm (Complexo Eólico Morrinhos), in the municipality of Campo Formoso, in the state of Bahia. The objectives of the action were: 1) to improve access to the community and; 2) the possibility of water supply, since the company uses water trucks to water the road, while in the community the cisterns are empty.
Remembering that for the implementation of wind farms it is common for access roads to be built and existing roads to be expanded, further impacting the surrounding communities. These roads are usually not paved and in the few hearings and/or public consultations about the implementation of the projects, questions are constantly raised about the maintenance of the access roads.
According to the disclosure on social networks, the decision to occupy the road was taken after the company CGN Brazil Energy (which acquired the Atlantic projects) did not open a channel for dialogue with the community and did not take effective actions to mitigate the impacts caused by the project. A letter containing the claims was delivered to representatives of CGN Brazil Energy (operator of the wind farm) and Marrikaah Environmental Licensing and Private Social Investment, since the first half of August, but none of the companies made a public statement.
On September 21, the social network of the Movimento Save as Serras (SAS) reported that until the end of the afternoon of September 20, the company CGN Brazil Energy had not issued any public notice regarding the demands made by the community. In the same release, it was informed that a representative of CGN Brazil Energy proposed a meeting, to be scheduled for September 28 (next Tuesday), a proposal rejected by the residents.
The negotiation lasted about three hours and CGN Brazil Energy called the Military Police to the mobilization, in an attempt to intimidate the community, an attitude understood by the protesters as arbitrary and unnecessary. According to the post, residents reported that members of the Military Police asked only to maintain order and peace in the area. There was no position from the Municipality of Campo Formoso on the case. 
Also on September 21, in the profile of the Organização Estadual das Comunidades Tradicionais de Fundo e Fecho de Pasto do estado da Bahia, it was disclosed that the community had completed 24 hours of resistance in blocking the access road to the Morrinhos Wind Complex, without any manifestation on the part of from the company. 
According to the release of the Save as Serras Movement, in the late afternoon of September 21, already heading towards the 48 hours of resistance, there was a dialogue with CGN Brazil Energy, which informed that it would only take a concrete position after 192 hours, moving in the opposite direction. the urgent request made by the Fazenda Quina community.
CGN Brazil Energy did not stop its activities and authorized its employees to follow an alternative route, since the main access road was blocked, thus bypassing the Varzinha community. This episode shows yet another disregard for the population of the community, which annoyed the leaders of other communities located nearby. These joined the demonstration and began to join forces with the act of mobilization. In addition to the Fazenda Quina community, the Borda da Mata, Poço dos Borges, Belas, Baixão and Varzinha communities were included in the action.
On September 22, 2021 (Wednesday) the Morrinhos Wind Complex had its operation paralyzed. Also on September 22, the Fazenda Quina community released a note about a protest against the Morrinhos Wind Farm.
On September 24, 2021, the Fazenda Quina community disclosed on a social network that after the agreement signed with CGN Brazil Energy on September 22, the company did not comply with the agreed points. The only feedback from CGN Brazil Energy was regarding the availability of reports for the months of January to April 2021 (and for more than a year the company has not provided information to the community.
In light of this scenario, on September 27, 2021, the Fazenda Quina, Belas, Baixão and Borda da Mata communities once again occupied the main access road to the Morrinhos Wind Farm. On September 29, 2021, the access road was once again released through new agreements between the communities, the company CGN Brazil Energy and the Municipality of Campo Formoso.";;;;;;;;;;"The impacts on local communities are multiple, being direct and indirect, in the short and long term. 

- Physical environment: Alteration in the local landscape, pollution of soil and surface and underground water resources, erosion, silting and instability of the bank, changes in local relief.

He realizes that there has been a major change in the physical environment of the place, making it clear that any action caused by human beings to the environment with such relevant consequences. in view of the dimensioned question, there is no way of avoiding emphasizing the socio-environmental impact caused by the communities neighboring the Morrinho Eolic complexes, since the same terrain that coexists with another landscape, artificial for at least what the 39-year assignment contract says. This means that the current generation of the community for the most part will not have their natural landscape back.

- Biotic environment: Loss of vegetated area and associated biodiversity, fragment and loss of habitats, elimination of representatives of wild fauna due to being run over, alteration of the fauna and flora relationship, loss of native plant communities, accidents with species of bats, accidents with species of migratory birds - Barrier Effect.

Side effect of this change will be in the reaction of the polygonal fauna of the wind farms. There is an example of feline species, which will move away from the region where they live, will probably approach communities and attack domestic animals, causing losses especially in the creation of goats or calves, according to residents of the Fazenda Quina, Belas, Borda da Mata communities.

Suppression of native vegetation, especially the Caatinga. There are species threatened with extinction in the location where the Morrinhos Wind Complex is installed, which may increase the risk of extinction.

- Community impacts:
Noises: constant noises caused by the wind turbines;
Particle emission (dust): report of loss in plantations located on the margins of the access roads used by the company;
Shading: possible shading effects caused by the Ventos do Sertão Wind Farm in the Traditional Community of Fazenda Quina. The study showed that a large part of the houses in the Fazenda Quina Community, especially those on the west face, would be subject to shading higher than the IFC limit of 30 hours / year taking into account the results of the worst case scenario, with such an effect occurring predominantly between 4:00 pm and 7:00 pm, with variations depending on the wind turbine that causes shading and the time of year.
He pointed out that of the 15 wind turbines that are part of the Ventos do Sertão Wind Farm, the greatest contributions to the shading effect are due to wind turbines number 09, 10.11, which are closest to the residences of the community in question.

- Impacts on the socioeconomic environment: there is real estate speculation. According to the Register of State Forestry of Rural Property, of the areas covered by the Morrinhos Wind Complex where of the total of 2,473.70 ha, only 24.2% belongs to local communities, the rest is on behalf of natural persons from the states of Ceará, in view of this fact observed in the research, it leads to our understanding that a new wave of land grabbing appears in the traditional communities of Fundo and Fecho de Pasto.

Noise pollution, air pollution, increased traffic in the area, increased risk of traffic accidents, limited land use and production activities, effects on the landscape. However, it must be said that traditional grassland communities suffer very serious interference from the implantation of wind farms, whether of a social, cultural or environmental nature, a fact that is perceived in this study carried out in the communities surrounding the Morrinhos Wind Farm.";There are reports that in the phase of implantation of the wind farm, the concessionaires create in the communities of ADA, AII, a false expectation, through the social policy program aimed at the communities, however this program only lasts during the period of installation of the enterprise, a fact that creates the false expectation of the communities.

Settled families suffer from the spraying of agrochemicals carried out by Umoe Bioenergy S.A., so that the cultivation of food crops by peasant families is directly affected. In fieldwork carried out in 2012 and 2014, the families of the Guarani settlement claim that livestock was impacted, the little cattle that the settlers had was dying because the pasture was frequently contaminated by pesticides. Also due to this spraying, there were no more bees in the settlement, which further helps in the loss of production. Thus, it is an environmental, food, economic and social impact. At the same time, at least in 2012, part of the plant's workers were settled, reflecting a proletarianization of rural workers. Another point that is important to highlight is that Umoe Bioenergy S.A. is located in Pontal do Paranapanema, west of the state of São Paulo, a region known for intense land conflicts, resulting from the large amount of illegal land, that is, land that belonged to the who had falsified property titles after the Land Law of 1850, enabling the formation of countless latifundios. In fieldwork on June 3, 2014, a camp of the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST) was found on a dirt road between the sugar cane plantations of Umoe Bioenergy SA and the former Odebrecht (currently Atvos, since the company changed its corporate name), between the municipalities of Teodoro Sampaio and Mirante do Paranapanema, however, only the area occupied by Umoe Bioenergy S.A. was claimed by the MST. The camp was called Sister Dorothy at that time. According to the campers present at the site during the fieldwork, they had been camped in the area since January 15, 2014. They started the camp with 45 families from the Irmã Goreti camp, in Marabá Paulista (SP), but on June 3 of 2014 at Sister Dorothy camp there were 22 families. According to the campers, they were in the area because the Land Institute of the State of São Paulo (ITESP), said that this would be a possible settlement area, however, so far, nothing had been declared. The campers reported impacts from aerial spraying carried out on the sugarcane plantation, which contaminates bodies of water near the camp. The field work took place during the scientific initiation research (2012 to 2014) developed during the undergraduate course in Geography, at the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP), which resulted in the monograph (course completion work) “O processo de estrangeirização da terra no Brasil: o estudo de caso da Umoe Bioenergy, Sandovalina (SP)"", defended and published in March 2015. According to INCRA, on November 21, 2016, the Irmã Dorothy Settlement was created, with 543.2668 hectares and with 34 settled families.";;;;;;;;;Environmental degradation|Socio-economic|Other;Food security and sovereignty;;;Education|Other;In 2015, according to the Umoe Bioenergy website, the main focus of the company's social responsibility was investing in social projects in education, housing, culture, health and social well-being. In 2014, there were two projects under execution, the São José Operário Project, aimed at social assistance to around 140 children and adolescents in the municipality of Pirapozinho (SP), directing activities in education environment, citizenship, family and professional market. The second project under execution by the plant was called “Portas Abertas”, which integrates and informs the community about the activities carried out by Umoe Bioenergy, this one has the objective of providing a relationship between citizens and the company. In addition to these two projects aimed at social responsibility, the plant supported the construction of popular housing, encouraging cultural projects.

It is estimated that six million tonnes of wood are annually transformed into 1.8million tons of charcoal from Bugoma forest at a cost ofshs40,000 ($ 11) a sack. Asimire Alice, a professional teacher and councilor for Kabwoya sub-county, says that the rate at which deforestation is taking place in Bugoma Forest worries the local community members, as they are complaining of the loss of natural herbs which they used to get from the special tree species in the forest.

Due to deforestation, there has been a direct loss of wildlife habitats. The removal of trees and other types of vegetation reduces available food, shelter, and breeding habitats. Wildlife is forced to migrate to survive and in doing so, end up in surrounding homes and gardens. This leads to increased human/wildlife conflict. According to WanaData (2021) there is also a high crime rate within the area, due to the increased number of people who were relocated from different areas of the country to help in cutting down trees, this has led to increased rape cases and defilement in the area.

But in a press statement, NEMA saidsugarcane would only be planted on part of the 5700-hectare area.
Conservation groups and forestry experts have long warned that destroying even just a part of the forest’s diversity would lead to a loss of fauna and flora, and affect the water levels of the River Nile.“We consider this plan not only detrimental to the Ugandan government plans to develop and invest in tourism in Bugoma Forest, but to the overall fragile and rich ecosystem [which] will simply be irreparably compromised,” said Tessarin, who is also director of Uganda Jungle Lodges and owner of Bugoma Jungle Lodge.

Conservationists have launched a social media campaign, “Save Bugoma Forest”, and are petitioning President Yoweri Museveni to intervene.“It is necessary that the government of Uganda and the national institutions intervene to resolve a matter that cannot be just a legal battle in court and cannot be only about boundaries of proposed land titles,” said Tessarin.";;;Conservation;It was considered a cultural site.
